Amnesia
An Interactive Fiction by Ben Helm
Release 1 / Serial number 140313 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) SD

roof

You stand up, dizzy, trying to remember any events that might have transpired leaving you in this dire predicament.  Nothing comes to mind.

A crumpled scrap of paper lies on the ground.

After an arduous descent down the rusting stairs, you find yourself in a dimly lit alley.  To the west you can see the street.  East the alley appears to go deeper, and gets darker as it goes.

Blinking in the bright sun you find yourself standing in the middle of a busy street.  People hurry by each other without making eye contact.

Directly in front of you is an ornate revolving door.  It appears to be an entrance to the building.  There is caution tape blocking it off.

Next to the door is a man leaning against the wall wearing a tuxedo.  He is tall and lean, and is smoking a cigarette.

You stand in the dim alley, with the street to the west and the alley extending to the east.

Nearby you lurks a mangy looking alley cat.  Perhaps it is safe to take with you as a companion.

street
Blinking in the bright sun you find yourself standing in the middle of a busy street.  People hurry by each other without making eye contact.  To the south is the sidewalk at the other side of the street.  Directly in front of you is an ornate revolving door.

Next to the door is a man leaning against the wall wearing a tuxedo.  He is tall and lean, and is smoking a cigarette.
